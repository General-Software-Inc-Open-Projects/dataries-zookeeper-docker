# What is Apache Zookeeper?

[Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) is a software project of the Apache Software Foundation, providing an open source distributed configuration service, synchronization service, and naming registry for large distributed systems. ZooKeeper was a sub-project of Hadoop but is now a top-level project in its own right.
